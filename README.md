Simple Music Player

A modified clone of the Music Player project from Brad Traversy's Udemy course "20 Web Projects." I retooled some of the UI and JS to make it my own thing.

Features a small playlist of some of the music I like (located in the Music folder), with buttons to play, skip, go to the previous song, and to shuffle songs.

The pop-up modal shows the titles of the song, artist, and album.
